Usage: python3 evaluate.py <reference_graphs_file> <test_graphs_file>

Set MAX_WORKERS in metrics/stats.py as per your convenience and number of cores on machine
Set EVAL_BATCH_SIZE in evaluate.py to change batch size that gets evaluated in one go. Running time of one batch increases O(batch_size ^ 2) with EVAL_BATCH_SIZE

Example:
python3 evaluate.py graphs_ref.txt graphs_ref.txt

In this example all metrics will evaluate to 0 as the test and reference graphs are the same
