Aproiori:
    1. Optimizations
        1.1 pruning step, checking in F^k-1 using hashset instead of set
        1.2 removing candidates according to threshold frequnecy can be done using iterator with same
        offset to set(set, frequency) set(set)
	1.3 in generateCandidates, the pruning step iterates through the set instead of using set.find; there can be improvements
    2. Modification
        2.1 Make support threshold float
        2.2 Lexicographically arrange final output (required?)
